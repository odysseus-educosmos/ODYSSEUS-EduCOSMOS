 * Description : 
 * (Following description is for original ODYSSEUS/COSMOS BfM.
 *  For ODYSSEUS/EduCOSMOS EduBfM, refer to the EduBfM project manual.)
 *
 *  Return a buffer which has the disk content indicated by `trainId'.
 *  Before the allocation of a buffer, look up the train in the buffer
 *  pool using hashing mechanism.   If the train already  exist in the pool
 *  then simply return it and set the reference bit of the correponding
 *  buffer table entry.   Otherwise, i.e. the train does not exist in the
 *  pool, allocate a buffer (a buffer selected as victim may be forced out
 *  by the buffer replacement algorithm), read a disk train into the 
 *  selected buffer train, and return it.
 *
 * Returns:
 *  error code
 *    eBADBUFFER_BFM - Invalid Buffer
 *    eBADBUFFERTYPE_BFM - Invalid Buffer type
 *    some errors caused by function calls
 *
 * Side effects:
 *  1) parameter retBuf
 *     pointer to buffer holding the disk train indicated by `trainId'
