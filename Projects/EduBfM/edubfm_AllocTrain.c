 * Function: Four edubfm_AllocTrain(Four)
 *
 * Description : 
 * (Following description is for original ODYSSEUS/COSMOS BfM.
 *  For ODYSSEUS/EduCOSMOS EduBfM, refer to the EduBfM project manual.)
 *
 *  Allocate a new buffer from the buffer pool.
 *  The used buffer pool is specified by the parameter 'type'.
 *  This routine uses the second chance buffer replacement algorithm
 *  to select a victim.  That is, if the reference bit of current checking
 *  entry (indicated by BI_NEXTVICTIM(type), macro for
 *  bufInfo[type].nextVictim) is set, then simply clear
 *  the bit for the second chance and proceed to the next entry, otherwise
 *  the current buffer indicated by BI_NEXTVICTIM(type) is selected to be
 *  returned.
 *  Before return the buffer, if the dirty bit of the victim is set, it 
 *  must be force out to the disk.
 *
 * Returns;
 *  1) An index of a new buffer from the buffer pool
 *  2) Error codes: Negative value means error code.
 *     eNOUNFIXEDBUF_BFM - There is no unfixed buffer.
 *     some errors caused by fuction calls
