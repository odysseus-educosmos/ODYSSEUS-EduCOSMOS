 *
 * Description:
 * (Following description is for original ODYSSEUS/COSMOS BtM.
 *  For ODYSSEUS/EduCOSMOS EduBtM, refer to the EduBtM project manual.)
 *
 *  At first, the function edubtm_SplitInternal(...) allocates a new internal page
 *  and initialize it.  Secondly, all items in the given page and the given
 *  'item' are divided by halves and stored to the two pages.  By spliting,
 *  the new internal item should be inserted into their parent and the item will
 *  be returned by 'ritem'.
 *
 *  A temporary page is used because it is difficult to use the given page
 *  directly and the temporary page will be copied to the given page later.
 *
 * Returns:
 *  error code
 *    some errors caused by function calls
 *
 * Note:
 *  The caller should call BfM_SetDirty() for 'fpage'.
