 *
 *  Free all pages which were related with the given page. If the given page
 *  is an internal page, recursively free all child pages before it is freed.
 *  In a leaf page, examine all leaf items whether it has an overflow page list
 *  before it is freed. If it has, recursively call itself by using the first
 *  overflow page. In an overflow page, it recursively calls itself if the
 *  'nextPage' exist.
 *
 * Returns:
 *  error code
